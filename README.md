# Uber Data Analysis (2024)

This project looks at Uber ride data and tries to answer simple questions like:  
- When do most people book rides?  
- Which vehicle types bring in more revenue?  
- What affects cancellations?  

I used **Excel for cleaning, SQL for exploration, and Power BI for dashboards**.  

---

## Key Steps  
- Cleaned and structured the dataset.  
- Wrote SQL queries to check bookings, cancellations, and revenue trends.  
- Built a few Power BI dashboards for easy visualization.
